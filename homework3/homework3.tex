\subsection*{Problem 1}
\subsubsection*{a.}
Because this is ordered, with replacement, there are $4^3$ or $64$ different codons. 

\subsubsection*{b.}
We need to find how many codons there are who's first and third base is either
\textit{A} or \textit{G} which can be expressed as $2^2$ or $4$, and the second base is 
\textit{C} or \textit{T}, which can be expressed as $2^1$ or $2$. If we multiply
the two probabilities together, we get a total of $8$ different codons that meet
the requirements.

\subsubsection*{c.}
Because this is ordered, without replacement, there are $\frac{4!}{(4-3)!}$
different codons, which simplifies to $24$ different codons. 

\subsection*{Problem 4}
The way that we can solve this problem is by breaking it up into two parts.
First, the number of ways to divide 10 players into two teams. This is
unordered, without replacement, or $10 \choose 5$, which reduces to $252$
combinations. Then, each combination has two options, a red uniform or a blue
uniform. We multiply $252$ by $2$ to get $454$ different ways of dividing 10
basketball players in two teams.
