\subsection{29}
\subsubsection{a.}
The probability that an item with a flaw will not be detected by the first
inspector is $0.1$. This means that if a flaw shows up with a probability of
$0.10$, the probability of an item passing by the first inspector with a flaw is
$0.1 \times 0.1$, or $0.01$. 

\subsubsection{b.}
We have that probability of the item passing by the first inspector with a flaw is $0.01$. The
second inspector has a probability of not detecting the flaw of $0.3$.
Therefore, the probability an item having an undetected flaw is $0.01 \times 0.3$,
or $0.003$. 

\subsection{30}
\subsubsection{a.}
The probability of someone testing positive and having a disease is as follows:

\[P(D|+) = \frac{(0.99)(0.05}{(0.99)(0.05)+(0.01)(0.95)}\]
\[P(D|+) = \frac{(0.99)(0.05}{(0.99)(0.05)+(0.01)(0.95)}\]
\[P(D|+) \approx 0.84\]

\subsubsection{b.}
The probability of someone testing negative and not having the disease is as
follows:
\[P(D^c|-) = \frac{P(-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(-|D^c)P(D^c)+P(-|D)P(D)} \]
\[P(D^c|-) = \frac{(0.99)(0.95)}{(0.99)(0.95)+(0.01)(0.05)} \]
\[P(D^c|-) \approx 0.999 \]

\subsection{31}
\subsubsection{a.}
The probability of one child not having the disease is $0.75$. Therefore, the
probability of two children not having the disease is $0.75^2$, or $0.5625$. 

\subsubsection{b.}
The probability that one child is a carrier is $0.5$. Therefore, the probability
of both children being carriers is $0.5^2$, or $0.25$. 

\subsubsection{c.}
The probability of both children being carriers given that neither have the
disease is as follows:

\[P(C) = 0.25 \]
\[P(D^c) = 0.5625 \]
\[P(C \cap D^c) = 0.25 \]
\[P(C|D^c) = \frac{P(C \cap D^c)}{P(D^c)} \]
\[P(C|D^c) = \frac{0.25}{0.5625} \]
\[P(C|D^c) \approx 0.\overline{4}  \]

\subsubsection{d.}
The probability of the woman being a carrier is $0.5$. The probability that the
child will have the disease if the woman is a carrier is $0.25$. Therefore, the
probability that the child will have the disease is $0.5 \times 0.25$ or
$0.125$. 

\subsection{33}
33. Refer to Example 2.26.
a. If a man tests negative, what is the probability that
he actually has the disease?
b. For many medical tests, it is standard procedure to
repeat the test when a positive signal is given. If
repeated tests are independent, what is the proba-
bility that a man will test positive on two successive
tests if he has the disease?
c. Assuming repeated tests are independent, what is
the probability that a man tests positive on two
successive tests if he does not have the disease?
d. If a man tests positive on two successive tests, what
is the probability that he has the disease?
\subsubsection{a.}
If a man tests negative, he has a probability as follows:

\[ P(D|-) = \frac{P(-|D)P(D)}{P(-|D)P(D)+P(-|D^c)P(D^c)} \]
\[ P(D|-) = \frac{(0.01)(0.005)}{(0.01)(0.005) + (0.01)(0.995)} \]
\[ P(D|-) = 0.005 \]

\subsubsection{b.}
The probability of testing positive on two tests given that he has the disease
is $0.99^2$ or $0.9801$.

\subsubsection{c.}
The probability of testing positive on two successive tests if he doesn't have
the disease is $0.01^2$ or $0.0001$. 

\subsubsection{d.}
The probability is as follows:

\[ P(D|+^2) = \frac{P(+^2|D)P(D)}{P(+^2|D)P(D)+P(+^2|D^c)P(D^c)} \]
\[ P(D|+^2) = \frac{(0.9801)(0.005)}{(0.9801)(0.005)+(0.0001)(0.995)} \]
\[ P(D|+^2) \approx 0.9801  \]

\section{Section 2.4}
\subsection{3}
\subsubsection{a.}
The mean number is as follows:

\[ \mu_x = 1(0.4)+2(0.2)+3(0.2)+4(0.1)+5(0.1) \]
\[ \mu_x = 2.3 \]

\subsubsection{b.}
The variance is as follows:

\[ \sigma^2_x = \sum_x (x-2.3)^2 P(X=x) \]
\[ \sigma^2_x = (1-2.3)^2 (0.4) + (2-2.3)^2(0.2) + (3-2.3)^2(0.2) +
                (4-2.3)^2(0.1) + (5-2.3)^2(0.1) \]
\[ \sigma^2_x = 1.81 \]

\subsubsection{c.}
The standard deviation is as follows:

\[ \sigma_x = \sqrt{\sigma^2_x} \]
\[ \sigma_x \approx \sqrt{1.81} \]
\[ \sigma_x \approx 1.35 \]

\subsubsection{d.}
The probability mass function is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{r|ccccc}
    x & $1 \times Y$ & $2 \times Y$ & $3 \times Y$ & $4 \times Y$ & $5 \times Y$ \\
    \hline
    $p(x)$ & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.1
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{e.}
The mean number of gallons ordered would be $2.3 \times Y$. 

\subsubsection{f.}
The variance of the number of gallons ordered would be $1.81 \times Y$. 

\subsubsection{g.}
The standard deviation of the number of gallons ordered is approximately 
$1.35 \times Y$. 

\subsection{4}
\subsubsection{a.}
$p_3(x)$ is the only function that all the probabilities add up to 1. Therefore,
it must be the probability mass function of X.

\subsubsection{b.}
$\mu_x$ is as follows:

\[ \mu_x = 0(0.2)+1(0.2)+2(0.3)+3(0.1)+4(0.1) \]
\[ \mu_x = 1.5 \]

$\sigma_x^2$ is as follows:

\[ \sigma_x^2 = (0.2)(0-1.5)^2 + (0.2)(1-1.5)^2 + (0.3)(2-1.5)^2 + (0.1)(4-1.5)^2 + (0.1)(5-1.5)^2 \]
\[ \sigma_x^2 = 2.425 \]

\subsection{5}
\subsubsection{a.}
The probability mass function is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{r|ccccc}
    x & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
    \hline
    $p(x)$ & 0.70 & 0.15 & 0.10 & 0.03 & 0.02
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{b.}
\[P(X \le 2) = 0.70 + 0.15 \]
\[P(X \le 2) = 0.85 \]

\subsubsection{c.}
\[P(X > 3) = 0.03 + 0.02 \]
\[P(X > 3) = 0.05 \]

\subsubsection{d.}
$\mu_x$ is as follows:

\[ \mu_x = 1(0.70)+2(0.15)+3(0.10)+4(0.03)+5(0.02) \]
\[ \mu_x = 1.52 \]

\subsubsection{e.}
$\sigma_x$ is as follows:

\[ \sigma_x^2 = (0.70)(1 - 1.52)^2 + (0.15)(2 - 1.52)^2 + (0.10)(3 - 1.52)^2 +
                (0.03)(4 - 1.52)^2 + (0.02)(5 - 1.52)^2 \]

\[ \sigma_x^2 = 0.8696 \]
\[ \sigma_x = \sqrt{0.8696} \]
\[ \sigma_x \approx 0.93 \]

\subsection{7}
\subsubsection{a.}
For $p(x)$ to be a probability mass function, $p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+p(4)$ needs to
equal $1$. 

\[ 1 = p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+p(4) \]
\[ 1 = 1c+2c+3c+4c \]
\[ 1 = 10c \]
\[ \frac{1}{10} = c \]
\[ 0.1 = c \]

For $p(x)$ to be a probability mass function, $c$ needs to be $0.1$. 

\subsubsection{b.}
\[ P(X=2) = 0.1 \times 2 \]
\[ P(X=2) = 0.2 \]

\subsubsection{c.}
